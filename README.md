# *flowR* Sample Codespace

This is a template repository that you can use to try out the *flowR* extension for Visual Studio Code right in your browser using [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). You don't even need to create your own repository!

The *flowR* extension in the codespace connects to a remote *flowR* server, so you'll be able to do anything that you can do with the *flowR* extension on Desktop.
